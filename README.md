Frauds are everywhere — wherever a transaction is involved— but credit card fraud is probably the most known case. It can be as primitive as stealing or using stolen cards, to aggressive forms such as account takeover, counterfeiting and more. Credit card frauds have always existed but the magnitude is only growing recently due to increasing online transactions taking place through credit cards every day. According to a Nilson Report in 2010, the amount of global fraud was USD 7.6 billion and is expected to cross a whopping USD 31 billion in 2020. In the UK alone fraudulent transactions losses were estimated at more than USD 1 billion in 2018.
The other kinds of big fraud cases are ongoing in insurance industries.
